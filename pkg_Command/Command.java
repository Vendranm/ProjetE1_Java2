package pkg_Command;import pkg_Character.Player;/** * This class is the main class of the "World of Zuul" application.  * "World of Zuul" is a very simple, text based adventure game.   * * This class holds information about a command that was issued by the user. * A command currently consists of two strings: a command word and a second * word (for example, if the command was "take map", then the two strings * obviously are "take" and "map"). *  * The way this is used is: Commands are already checked for being valid * command words. If the user entered an invalid command (a word that is not * known) then the command word is <null>. * * If the command had only one word, then the second word is <null>. *  * @author  Michael Kolling and David J. Barnes * @version 1.0 (February 2002) */public abstract class Command{    private String aSecondWord;    /**     * Create a command object.
